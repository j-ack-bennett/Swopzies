## Enspiral Dev Academy - Final Group Project

Goods and services are expensive... why not offer a way for the community to come together and trade skills, knowledge and home baked goods.

This is an app for people to list goods and services that they need, or want to share within their community.

The idea of the app is for people to add posts when they are in need of specific goods and services for trade, or are wanting to provide their own goods and services for trade. It is aimed at people of all demographics, whether it's someone who is retired and offering their services in their spare time, or a busy young professional wanting someone to walk their dog.

The hope is to provide a platform for people who are wanting to trade their skills and crafts, but don't have money in mind while doing so. Who doesn't like a good old barter??
